# MessagesApp - Demo 1

## Introduction
This demo application illustrates an Angular application with full client-side data (no data being loaded from a backend api). It has it's data stored and managed locally inside of the message-box component.

In the next demo, loading data from a server api will be introduced.

### Redux / NgRx implementation
The NgRx implementation of full client-side state management is implemented in demo-03. This is separated from the server-side data implementation to introduce the core concepts of actions and reducers separate from side-effects with Ngrx Effects.

## Run the application using a development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
