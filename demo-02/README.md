# MessagesApp - Demo 2

## Introduction
This demo application illustrates an more fledged out Angular application with a service returning data from a backend web api. The backend server is available in the repository as well. See 'Run the data api server'.

### Redux / NgRx implementation
The NgRx implementation of full NgRx state management using actions, reducers and effects can be found in demo-04.

## Run the application using a development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Run the data api server
In a separate console, go to the demo-server folder and run 'npm start'.
